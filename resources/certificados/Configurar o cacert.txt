1- I downloaded the cacert.pem from https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html

2- I copied the cert to /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem

3- I added this line to the php.ini:
openssl.cafile="/usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem"
curl.cainfo="/usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem"

4- restart the server and done.
